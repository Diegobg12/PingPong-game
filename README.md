# Ping Pong Game

This is a Ping Pong game for two peopleplayers. The winner of this game will be the first person to score 5 goals. To make this more interesting, once a player score a goal, his paddle will get shorter to give advantage to the other player. Also, in the middle of the game a second ball will appear. To play, the first player use the keys ``W`` to move up and ``S`` to move down. The second player use the arrows on the keyboard.
